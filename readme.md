# OpenGL Cube Rendering with GLFW

This Python script demonstrates how to render a rotating 3D cube using OpenGL and GLFW (a multi-platform library for creating windows with OpenGL contexts). The cube is rendered with shaders and can be rotated using the mouse or keyboard inputs.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- GLFW library (you can install it using `pip install glfw`)
- PyOpenGL library (you can install it using `pip install PyOpenGL`)

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python, GLFW, and PyOpenGL installed.

2. Run the `main.py` script.

3. A window will appear displaying a rotating 3D cube.

4. You can use the mouse to interactively rotate the cube.

5. You can also use the keyboard arrow keys to rotate the cube in different directions.

6. Press the 'Esc' key or close the window to exit the program.

## Features

- The cube is rendered using shaders (vertex and fragment shaders) defined in the script.

- GLFW is used for window management and user input handling.

- The cube rotates continuously around its axis.


Feel free to use this script as a starting point for OpenGL projects or extend it for your specific 3D rendering needs!
